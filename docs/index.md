# OneFuse Provider

OneFuse is the first codeless solution for automating, integrating, and extending private and hybrid cloud infrastructure. Through OneFuseâ€™s dynamic templating technology, enterprises can build integrations (e.g., for IT technologies like IPAM, DNS, networking and security, etc.) into API-consumable policies for sharing across various IT teams and cloud environments.
